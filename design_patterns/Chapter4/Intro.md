# Behavioural Design Patterns

Behavioural patterns are concerned with algorithms and assignment of responsibiltiies between objects.

## Chain of Responsibility
*Lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.*

## Command
*Turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request.* This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a request's execution, and support undoable operations.

## Iterator
*Lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc)*

## Mediator
*Lets you reduce chaotic dependencies between objects. The pattern restricts communications between the objects and forces them to collaborate only via mediator object.*

## Memento
*Lets you save and restore the previous state of an object without revealing the details of its implementation.*

## Observer
*Lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they're observing.*

## State
*Lets an object alter its behaviour when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object changes its class.*

## Strategy
*Lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a seperate class, and make their objects interchangeable.*

## Template Method
*Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without change its structure.*


## Visitor
*Lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate.*
