# Long Parameter List
More than three or four parameters for a method.

## Reasons for the Problem
A long list for parameters might happen after several types of algorithms are merged in a single method. A long list may have been created to control which algorithm will be run and how.

Long paramter lists may also be the byproduct of efforts to make classes more independent of each other. For example,
